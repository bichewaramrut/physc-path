## Notes

The patient module has been significantly enhanced with improved mobile responsiveness and the addition of medication adherence tracking. Users can now mark medications as "taken" and the system will remember this status, making it easier to track adherence to prescribed treatments.

The medication reminders system now groups reminders by day and allows filtering by various time periods (today, tomorrow, this week). This makes it easier for patients to plan their medication schedule.

Next steps include implementing push notifications, enhancing the user preferences for reminders, and completing the integration with payment/invoice systems.
