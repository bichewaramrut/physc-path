Mental health is a vital component of overall well-being, influencing how individuals think, feel, and behave in daily life. Good mental health allows people to cope with stress, build relationships, and make decisions effectively. However, mental health challenges such as anxiety, depression, and stress-related disorders are on the rise globally. Many people struggle to access proper mental healthcare due to geographical, financial, or social barriers.
